<h1 style="color: red;text-align: center;"> Inline Styles </h1>
<p style="color: green; font-size: medium;"> An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.</p>
<h2> Disadvantages </h2>
<ul style="color: blue;">
<li>Inline styles make the HTML code messy and harder to read because mixing of styling instructions right into the HTML tags.</li>
<br>
<li>If we want to change the look of the website, it's not easy with inline styles. You have to go to each HTML tag and change the style individually.</li>
<br>
<li>We can't reuse styles easily. If you want two things to look the same, you have to copy the style to both, making your code longer and more prone to mistakes.</li>
</ul>
