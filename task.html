      <p style="background-color: coral;">The Ayodhya Ram Mandir, officially known as the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, holds historical and religious significance in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. The site has been a focal point of reverence for centuries, believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama, a revered deity in Hinduism. The Ayodhya dispute, primarily centered around the Babri Masjid that stood at the site, was a longstanding legal and political issue in India.

        In a landmark judgment in 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of allowing the construction of a Hindu temple at the disputed site, bringing a legal resolution to the Ayodhya dispute. This decision paved the way for the construction of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.
        
        On August 5, 2020, a significant event took place with the Bhumi Pujan, a groundbreaking ceremony marking the formal commencement of the temple's construction. Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over the Bhumi Pujan, signifying the beginning of this historic project.
        
        The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust is responsible for supervising the construction of the temple. This trust plays a crucial role in overseeing the entire project, ensuring that the construction adheres to the planned design and timeline.
        
        On January 22, 2024, another notable ceremony, the Prana Pratishtha, took place. Prime Minister Narendra Modi served as the Mukhya Yajman (chief patron) for the rituals, participating in the consecration of Ram Lalla. This event marked a significant step in the religious and cultural journey of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir.
        
        As of my knowledge cutoff in January 2022, the construction of the temple is ongoing, and it is anticipated to become a major pilgrimage site upon completion. The Ayodhya Ram Mandir holds deep cultural and religious significance for millions of Hindus, and its construction is a significant chapter in the history of India. Please note that developments may have occurred after my knowledge cutoff in January 2022.

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p style="background-color:hotpink">The original design for Ram Mandir was devised in 1988 by the Sompura family of Ahmedabad.[2] The Sompuras have contributed to the design of over 100 temples worldwide for at least 15 generations, including the Somnath temple.[46] The chief architect of the temple was Chandrakant Sompura, assisted by his two sons, Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, who are also architects.[47]

        A new design, with some changes from the original, was prepared by the Sompuras in 2020,[47] per the Hindu texts, the Vastu shastra and the Shilpa shastras.[48] The temple will be 76 metres (250 ft) wide, 120 metres (380 ft) long and 49 metres (161 ft) high.[49] Upon completion, the temple complex became the world's third largest Hindu temple.[47] It is designed in the MƒÅru-Gurjara architecture of Nagara style, a type of Hindu temple architecture found primarily in northern India.[46] A model of the proposed temple was showcased during the Prayag Kumbh Mela in 2019.[50]
        
        The temple's main structure has been built on a raised platform with three storeys. It has five mandapas in the middle of the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) and on the entrance passage. Three mandapas on one side are of Kudu, Nritya and Rang, and the two mandapas on the other side are of Kirtan and Prarthana. In Nagara style, the mandapas are decorated with shikharas.[51][52]
        Ram Lalla Virajman, the infant form of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, is the presiding deity of the temple.[60] Ram Lalla's dress was stitched by tailors Bhagwat Prasad and Shankar Lal, a fourth generation tailor to Rama's idol.[61] Ram Lalla was a litigant in the court case over the disputed site in 1989, being considered a "juristic person" by the law.[2] He was represented by Triloki Nath Pandey, a senior VHP leader who was considered Ram Lalla's closest 'human' friend.[60] According to the temple trust, the final blueprint included temples dedicated to Surya, Ganesha, Shiva, Durga, Vishnu and Brahma in the temple grounds.[62] Two idols of Ram Lalla (one of them being 5 years old) is consecrated in the sanctum of the temple.[53]

        On 29 December 2023, the selection of the idol of Ram Lalla for the Ram Mandir was done through a voting process. A sculptor, known for various statues across India created by him, Arun Yogiraj, from Mysore, Karnataka, created the idol of Rama.[63][64][65]        The temple has a total of 366 columns. The columns have 16 idols each to include the incarnations of Shiva, the 10 Dashavataras, the Chausath Yoginis, and the 12 incarnations of the goddess Saraswati. The width of the stairs are 4.9 metres (16 ft). Per scriptures dedicated to the design of temples dedicated to Vishnu, the sanctum sanctorum is octagonal in shape.[48] The temple covers an area of 10 acres (0.040 km2), while the remaining 57 acres (0.23 km2) of land has been developed into a complex with a prayer hall, a lecture hall, an educational facility and other facilities including a museum and a cafeteria.[32] According to the temple committee, the site has a capability to handle 70,000 visitors.[53] Larsen & Toubro offered to oversee the design and construction of the temple free of cost, and became the contractor of the project.[54][55] The Central Building Research Institute, National Geophysical Research Institute and the Bombay, Guwahati and Madras IITs have assisted in areas such as soil testing, concrete supply and design.[56][57]
        The construction work has been accomplished with 17,000 m3 (600,000 cu ft) of sandstone from Baansi in Rajasthan.[48] No iron and steel has been used in the construction of the temple, and the fusing of the stone blocks has required ten thousand copper plates.[58] In a culturally significant move, Thailand also symbolically contributed to the inauguration of the Ram Mandir, by sending soil to the Ram Janmabhoomi, building on their prior gesture of sending water from two rivers in Thailand to honour the temple.[59]</p>
